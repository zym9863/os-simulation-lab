## üìä Algorithm Comparison

### Process Scheduling Algorithms
| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Pros | Cons | Scenarios |
|-----------|----------------|------|------|-----------|
| FCFS | O(n) | Simple, fair | Convoy effect | Batch systems |
| RR | O(1) | Good response | Context switch overhead | Time-sharing systems |
| Priority | O(log n) | Important processes first | Possible starvation | Real-time systems |
| SJF | O(log n) | Shortest waiting time | Long process starvation | Batch systems |

### Memory Allocation Algorithms
| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Pros | Cons | Scenarios |
|-----------|----------------|------|------|-----------|
| First Fit | O(n) | Fast | Small fragments | General |
| Best Fit | O(n) | High utilization | Long search time | Memory tight |
| Worst Fit | O(n) | Large remaining blocks | Low utilization | Large block needs |
